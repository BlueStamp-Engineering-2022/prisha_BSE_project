# Emotive Robot
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
For my main project, I am building an emotive robot. This robot, as of right now, displays 3 different emotions based on distance using an ultrasonic sensor. For my first milestone, I have essentially got all the different aspects of the robot (eyes, brows, neck, head, and message display working together to show the emotions. When I hover my hand over the sensor, these 8x8 matrices light up to show angry or sad eyes instead of neutral. The only other way emotions are conveyed on the face is through the two servos for the eyebrows. There is also an LCD display that displays text that indicates the emotion on the face. The two neck and head servos move depending on the current emotion as well. I enjoyed getting all of the pieces soldered and connected to the breadboard and arduino. But I struggled to learn how to code (especially for the servos that control the head and neck). As for the next steps, I will need to add a Bluetooth aspect to be able to control the robot using my phone, download WAV files to test sound and build the robot itself.

# Starter Project - Useless Machine
For my starter project here at Bluestamp, I built a useless machine. In its essence this machine uses a motor, two switches, and an LED to work the way it does. One of the switches is a DPDT (or a double pull double throw). This switch changes positions to turn the motor in one direction which gets the arm to move up. While this happens the arm releases the snap switch and the LED turns green here. Then the arm pushes the switch back to its starting position , causing current to start moving in the opposite direction, reversing the motor and returning the arm down to its initial position. Now the LED turns red and the arm presses back onto the snap switch. I really enjoyed learning to solder and it was great seeing it all work. On the other hand, I struggled a bit to learn how to solder and putting the box itself together was definitely a struggle. The screws were hard to put in as well.
