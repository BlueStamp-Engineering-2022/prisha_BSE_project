# Emotive Robot
My project is a emotive robot inspired by Wall-E. It wakes up feeling neutral, and then becomes happy or sad depending on your distance from it. It also goes through a range of other emotions through by the prees of a button from my phone!

# Final Milestone
For my last milestone I got the bluetooth aspect of my robot working. I enjoyed making new emotions. But I struggled to get the bluetooth and the buttons to work.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone, I changed my wiring to make it more permanent and am using a perf board instead of a breadboard. I also finished the main build of the robot. I enjoyed making the build. But I struggled to get the wiring done so that it doesn't break and isn't too messy. Next I have to do the Bluetooth aspect to be able to control the robot using my phone.

# First Milestone
For my main project, I am building an emotive robot. This robot, as of right now, displays 3 different emotions based on distance using an ultrasonic sensor. For my first milestone, I have essentially got all the different aspects of the robot (eyes, brows, neck, head, and message display working together to show the emotions. When I hover my hand over the sensor, these 8x8 matrices light up to show angry or sad eyes instead of neutral. The only other way emotions are conveyed on the face is through the two servos for the eyebrows. There is also an LCD display that displays text that indicates the emotion on the face. The two neck and head servos move depending on the current emotion as well. I enjoyed getting all of the pieces soldered and connected to the breadboard and arduino. But I struggled to learn how to code (especially for the servos that control the head and neck). As for the next steps, I will need to add a Bluetooth aspect to be able to control the robot using my phone, download WAV files to test sound and build the robot itself.

# Starter Project - Useless Machine
For my starter project here at Bluestamp, I built a useless machine. In its essence this machine uses a motor, two switches, and an LED to work the way it does. One of the switches is a DPDT (or a double pull double throw). This switch changes positions to turn the motor in one direction which gets the arm to move up. While this happens the arm releases the snap switch and the LED turns green here. Then the arm pushes the switch back to its starting position , causing current to start moving in the opposite direction, reversing the motor and returning the arm down to its initial position. Now the LED turns red and the arm presses back onto the snap switch. I really enjoyed learning to solder and it was great seeing it all work. On the other hand, I struggled a bit to learn how to solder and putting the box itself together was definitely a struggle. The screws were hard to put in as well.
